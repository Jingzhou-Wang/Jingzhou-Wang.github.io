# Physical Reasoning

## Abstract

Physical Reasoning is a research area that aims to build machines that can reason about the physical world. It is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The goal of this research is to build machines that can understand the physical world and interact with it. This is a very challenging task, as the physical world is very complex and it is difficult to model it. However, there are many applications of this research, such as robotics, self-driving cars, and many more.
